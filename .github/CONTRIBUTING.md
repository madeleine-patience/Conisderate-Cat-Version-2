Thank you for pouncing into **Considerate Cat Tarot - Version 2**! This guide
will help you make pawsitive contributions and keep our project purr-fectly
maintained.

## How to Contribute

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Link an Issue**:

   - Make sure your pull request is associated with a relevant issue. This helps
     us keep our paws on track and ensures that nothing gets overlooked. If
     thereâ€™s no issue to scratch, create one before submitting your pull
     request.

2. **Ensure Functionality**:

   - Test your changes to ensure all components are consistent in both the main
     application and Storybook. We need every fantastic feature to work smoothly
     in both environments.

3. **Use Built-Ins When Possible**:

   - Prefer using built-in components and utilities from our included
     frameworks. This helps maintain a consistent look and reduces our
     dependency clutter.

4. **Follow the Pull Request Template**:
   - Make sure to follow the instructions in the
     [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/madeleine-patience/Considerate-Cat-Version-2-With-Next/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

2.  **Set Up Supabase** (recommended):

    - To get a local instance of Supabase purring smoothly, follow these steps:
    - Install Supabase CLI:
      [Supabase CLI Installation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)
    - Start a local Supabase instance:
      ```bash
      supabase start
      ```
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your
      Supabase configuration. Example:

      ```dotenv
      SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
      SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
      ```

    - **Schema coming soon!**

## Versioning and Changelog

1.  **Semantic Versioning**:

    - We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
    - **MAJOR**: For incompatible changes (Non-compatible changes to
      application/API).
    - **MINOR**: For backward-compatible new features (when we get a new toy).
    - **PATCH**: For backward-compatible bug fixes (when we tidy up the litter
      box).

2.  **Bumping Versions**:

    - Update the version in `package.json` to match the changes. Increment the
      minor version for new features and the patch version for bug fixes.

3.  **Updating the Changelog**:

    - Record your changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Include a summary of new
      features, improvements, and fixes. "Unreleased" is the first item in the
      Changelog, please copy it and use it to note your changes for your pull
      request.

4.  **Branch Naming**:
    - Your format should include the intent, issue number, and as much of the
      issue title that makes sense.
    - E.G. `Issue: #42 Purrlaroid Footer Colors Have Bad Contrast`
      - Good Examples:
        - `#42-improve-purrlaroid-color-contrast`
        - `fixes-#42-footer-color-contrast`
        - `42-adjust-footer-color-contrast`
      - Bad Examples:
        - `CC-branch-purrlaroid-footer-colors`
        - `42-purrlaroid-component`
        - `branch-pr-issue-42`
    - Use this format to clearly associate the branch with a specific issue or
      task, ensuring that the issue number is included for easy reference.
